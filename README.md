# Fallout 76 Launcher
A Bethesda-Styled Fallout 76 Launcher because they didn't make one.

* The same layout as Bethesda's Fallout 4 and Skyrim pre-game launchers
* **[WIP]** Change your game settings! (Preset Loading Works!)
* You can grab the latest build from [here](https://github.com/kran27/Fallout76Launcher/raw/master/Fallout76Launcher/bin/Debug/Fallout76Launcher.exe), but it will have unfinished features! I publish a release once the features are finished.
